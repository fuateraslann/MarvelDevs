# Pointo Marvel Devs

## What I have done ?

- I created the desired design in the application. I used material UI components when creating this design. I had to add inline-css at some points.
- I provided the desired data flow .
- I used the react-query library , which I found effective, in the application for data fetching and state management.
- I made a responsive design with MUI Grid component.
- I wrote the snapshot test and unit test .
- Comic list is horizontal . You can scroll to see other comics.

## I am sad with

- Unfortunately , I had limited time to make this task because of busy at my work so I couldn't write the test in detail.
- I would like to split all components for common use like I did in character card .
- I would like to write open-closed reusable components if I had enough time.
- I can show the comics with more detail .
